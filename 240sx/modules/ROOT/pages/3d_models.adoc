Models of the 240sx chassis and Spark EV components were created with 3D scanners.

== 240sx Chassis

The engine bay was scanned with the Revopoint POP scanner over multiple attempts.
The entire engine bay was covered in masking tape, and alignment stickers were placed
on the tape throughout the bay. The POP scans were prone to drift in positional accuracy
over distances larger than a foot or so, so the entire bay was scanned a corner at a time,
then merged together in post.

The underbody was scanned with RPLidar based area scanner. The mesh shown below is a
combination of 24 discrete scans.

An S13 240sx model was extracted from an 
https://assetto-db.com/car/240sx_ka[Assetto Corsa addon] as a CAD reference, and for future
aerodynamic simulations with https://www.openfoam.com/[OpenFOAM].
The model aligns reasonably well with the chassis scans.

The model creates some reasonable looking renders as well.

== EV Components

The motor, transaxle, battery cell, and power electronics were all 3D scanned with the Revopoint POP.
